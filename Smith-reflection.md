What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I sturggled with some GitHub usage along with some branching technique.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I understood more clearly some of branching techniques

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked some specific branching questions regarding creating a new branch and merging/pushing to github to my pair.  Regina was helpful with explanation as well.

What still confuses you about Git?

I feel like I have the workflow down, it's just changing branches and merging concepts that I have to think about a litlle more than I want to right now.  I want it to be second nature. 


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was enjoyable.  My partner was very knowledgeable and intersted in explaining a few things to me.
